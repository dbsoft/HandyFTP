HandyFTP 1.0 beta 5

These clients have not been thoroughly tested, they are under development, I am
dropping the latest binaries and source code every couple of days.  They
are not claimed to work as intended, they are here so I can get feedback during 
development and debugging.  The source code is available also so if something
is not working you are welcome to fix it, or if you want something to work 
differently feel free to change it and submit the changes to me.  Feel 
free to do with this as you please as long as credit is given where deserved.
